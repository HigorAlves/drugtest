# 💊 Drug Indication Mapping Microservice

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a microservice to **extract drug indications** from **DailyMed** drug labels, **map them to ICD-10 codes using AI/LLM**, and expose a **secure API** for CRUD operations and queries.

Built with:
- **Node.js (NestJS)** for the API
- **Dockerized deployment**
- **Clean/Hexagonal Architecture**
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- **TurboRepo** for monorepo management

---

## 🎯 **Problem We Solve**

Healthcare data is fragmented. Drug indications in free-text labels must be standardized to integrate into medical systems.

✅ Automatically extract indications from DailyMed using Puppeteer  
✅ Map to standard **ICD-10** codes using OpenAI API  
✅ Serve structured data via API  
✅ Support CRUD + role-based access

```

### Clean/Hexagonal Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture approach with three main layers:

1. **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and rules, independent of external frameworks or technologies.
   - Domain models (Drug, Indication, User)
   - Repository interfaces
   - Service interfaces

2. **Application Layer**: Contains use cases that orchestrate the flow of data to and from the domain layer.
   - Use cases for CRUD operations
   - Use cases for mapping indications to ICD-10 codes

3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Contains adapters that implement interfaces defined in the domain layer.
   - Database adapters (TypeORM)
   - HTTP adapters (NestJS controllers)
   - External service adapters (OpenAI API)

This architecture provides:
- ✅ **Separation of concerns**  
- ✅ **Testability** of domain and application layers  
- ✅ **Maintainability** as changes to one layer don't affect others  
- ✅ **Flexibility** to replace infrastructure components

## 📝 **API Documentation**

### Authentication

#### Register a new user

```
POST /api/auth/register
{
  "username": "user",
  "password": "password"
}
```

#### Login

```
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "username": "user",
  "password": "password"

## ⚙️ **Scalability Considerations**

### Current Scalability Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Components can be scaled independently
- **Stateless API**: Allows horizontal scaling
- **Docker Containerization**: Facilitates deployment to orchestration platforms

### Future Scalability Improvements

- **Async Processing Queue**: Implement a queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for scraping and mapping tasks
- **Caching Layer**: Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data and AI mapping results
- **Database Scaling**: Implement database sharding or read replicas for high traffic
- **Microservices Split**: Separate scraper and AI mapping into independent microservices
- **API Gateway**: Add an API gateway for rate limiting, caching, and routing
- **Serverless Functions**: Move specific workloads to serverless for automatic scaling
