# Application Package

## Overview
The application package implements use cases and application-specific logic. It orchestrates the flow of data to and from the domain entities and directs them to perform their operations. This layer acts as a mediator between the domain layer and the external world.

## Structure
The application package is organized by application contexts, with each context following a consistent structure based on the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern:

```
application/
├── src/
│   ├── [name]/           # Template directory for new application contexts
│   │   ├── commands/     # Command handlers for write operations
│   │   ├── dtos/         # Data Transfer Objects for input/output
│   │   ├── event-handlers/# Handlers for domain events
│   │   ├── handlers/     # Generic handlers
│   │   ├── mappers/      # Mappers between domain entities and DTOs
│   │   ├── queries/      # Query handlers for read operations
│   │   └── validators/   # Input validation logic
│   └── index.ts          # Package entry point
```

## Folder Descriptions

### Commands
Contains command handlers that implement write operations. Commands are used to modify the state of the system and typically represent user intentions.

### DTOs
Contains Data Transfer Objects that define the structure of data passing in and out of the application layer. DTOs are used to decouple the domain model from the external representation of data.

### Event Handlers
Contains handlers for domain events. Event handlers respond to domain events and may trigger additional actions or side effects.

### Handlers
Contains generic handlers for various operations that don't fit neatly into commands or queries.

### Mappers
Contains mappers that transform data between domain entities and DTOs. Mappers ensure that the domain model remains isolated from external concerns.

### Queries
Contains query handlers that implement read operations. Queries are used to retrieve data from the system without modifying its state.

### Validators
Contains validation logic for input data. Validators ensure that data entering the system meets the required constraints before it's processed.

## Best Practices
- Keep the application layer focused on orchestrating use cases
- Use commands for write operations and queries for read operations
- Keep command and query handlers small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use DTOs to transfer data between layers
- Validate input data before processing
- Use mappers to transform data between domain entities and DTOs
- Handle domain events to maintain consistency across the system
- Design for testability
