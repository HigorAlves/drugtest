# Domain Package

## Overview
The domain package contains the core business logic, entities, and business rules of the application. It represents the heart of the system and is independent of any external frameworks or technologies.

## Structure
The domain package is organized by domain entities or bounded contexts, with each context following a consistent structure based on domain-driven design principles:

```
domain/
├── src/
│   ├── [name]/           # Template directory for new domain contexts
│   │   ├── aggregates/   # Aggregate roots that maintain consistency boundaries
│   │   ├── entities/     # Domain entities with identity and lifecycle
│   │   ├── events/       # Domain events that represent state changes
│   │   ├── repositories/ # Repository interfaces for data access
│   │   ├── services/     # Domain services for operations that don't belong to entities
│   │   └── value-objects/# Immutable objects without identity
│   ├── user/             # User domain context
│   │   ├── aggregates/   # User-related aggregate roots
│   │   ├── entities/     # User-related entities
│   │   ├── events/       # User-related domain events
│   │   ├── repositories/ # User-related repository interfaces
│   │   ├── services/     # User-related domain services
│   │   └── value-objects/# User-related value objects
│   └── index.ts          # Package entry point
```

## Folder Descriptions

### Aggregates
Contains aggregate roots that maintain consistency boundaries within the domain. Aggregates are clusters of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit.

### Entities
Contains domain entities that have identity and lifecycle. Entities are objects that are defined by their identity rather than their attributes.

### Events
Contains domain events that represent state changes within the domain. Domain events are used to communicate between different parts of the system.

### Repositories
Contains repository interfaces for data access. Repositories provide a way to access and persist domain objects without exposing the underlying data store.

### Services
Contains domain services for operations that don't naturally belong to entities. Domain services encapsulate domain logic that doesn't fit within a single entity.

### Value Objects
Contains immutable objects without identity. Value objects are objects that are defined by their attributes rather than their identity.

## Best Practices
- Keep the domain layer free from dependencies on external frameworks or technologies
- Focus on expressing the business rules and logic clearly
- Use ubiquitous language from the domain throughout the code
- Ensure that domain objects enforce their invariants
- Design for testability
