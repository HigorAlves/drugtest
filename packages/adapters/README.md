# Adapters Package

## Overview
The adapters package provides adapters for external services and infrastructure. It implements the interfaces defined by the application layer and connects the application to external systems. This layer acts as a bridge between the application core and the outside world.

## Structure
The adapters package is organized by the type of external service or infrastructure component it interfaces with:

```
adapters/
├── src/
│   ├── auth/             # Authentication adapters
│   ├── cache/            # Caching adapters
│   ├── database/         # Database adapters
│   ├── graphql/          # GraphQL adapters
│   ├── http/             # HTTP adapters
│   ├── logger/           # Logging adapters
│   ├── messaging/        # Messaging adapters
│   ├── storage/          # Storage adapters
│   └── index.ts          # Package entry point
```

## Folder Descriptions

### Auth
Contains adapters for authentication and authorization services. These adapters handle user authentication, token management, and permission verification.

### Cache
Contains adapters for caching services. These adapters provide mechanisms for storing and retrieving frequently accessed data to improve performance.

### Database
Contains adapters for database access. These adapters implement repository interfaces defined in the domain layer and handle the persistence of domain entities.

### GraphQL
Contains adapters for GraphQL APIs. These adapters handle GraphQL schema definition, resolvers, and query execution.

### HTTP
Contains adapters for HTTP communication. These adapters handle RESTful API requests and responses, including serialization and deserialization of data.

### Logger
Contains adapters for logging services. These adapters provide mechanisms for recording application events and errors.

### Messaging
Contains adapters for messaging services. These adapters handle communication between different parts of the system or with external systems through message queues.

### Storage
Contains adapters for file storage services. These adapters handle file upload, download, and management.

## Best Practices
- Keep adapters focused on translating between the application core and external systems
- Implement interfaces defined by the application layer
- Isolate external dependencies within the adapters layer
- Handle serialization and deserialization of data
- Manage external service connections and lifecycle
- Handle errors from external services and translate them to domain errors
- Write comprehensive tests with appropriate mocking of external services
- Design for testability and replaceability
