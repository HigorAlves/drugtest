# Shared Package

## Overview
The shared package contains shared utilities, types, and helpers used across the application. It provides common functionality that can be used by any other package, promoting code reuse and consistency throughout the codebase.

## Structure
The shared package is organized by the type of utility or helper it provides:

```
shared/
├── src/
│   ├── date-time/        # Date and time utilities
│   ├── error/            # Error handling utilities
│   ├── rbac/             # Role-Based Access Control utilities
│   ├── validation/       # Validation utilities
│   └── index.ts          # Package entry point
```

## Folder Descriptions

### Date-Time
Contains utilities for working with dates and times. These utilities provide a consistent way to handle date and time operations throughout the application, including formatting, parsing, and calculations.

### Error
Contains error handling utilities. These utilities provide a standardized approach to error handling, including custom error classes, error logging, and error transformation.

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
Contains utilities for implementing role-based access control. These utilities help manage user permissions and access rights based on roles, ensuring that users can only access the resources they are authorized to use.

### Validation
Contains validation utilities. These utilities provide a consistent way to validate data throughout the application, including input validation, business rule validation, and data integrity checks.

## Best Practices
- Keep utilities focused on a single responsibility
- Make utilities reusable across different parts of the application
- Avoid dependencies on domain-specific logic in shared utilities
- Document utility functions and their parameters
- Write comprehensive tests for shared utilities
- Ensure utilities are type-safe and provide appropriate error handling
- Avoid circular dependencies between shared utilities and other packages
- Design for performance and efficiency, especially for frequently used utilities
